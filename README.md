 Overview

This project trains a regression model to predict how a patient’s diabetes may progress based on medical features such as BMI, blood pressure, and serum measurements.
It’s a beginner-friendly project demonstrating:
	•	Data loading & exploration
	•	Feature understanding
	•	Train/test splitting
	•	Standardization
	•	Linear Regression model
	•	RMSE & R² evaluation
	•	Prediction on an example input


 Personal 

This project is meaningful to me on a personal level.

My father is diabetic, and growing up, I witnessed how important early detection and proper monitoring are.
Working on this model helped me combine machine learning with real-life health challenges that affect people I care about.

It also pushed me to learn how data science can contribute to healthcare and improve quality of life.
This is one of the main reasons I chose to study Data Science and pursue advanced research in the future.


 Dataset

The project uses the Diabetes Dataset provided by scikit-learn.
It contains 442 samples, each with 10 medical features.



 Model

Algorithm: Linear Regression
	•	RMSE and R² are used to evaluate performance
	•	Features are standardized using StandardScaler

This is a simple baseline model, but it teaches important foundations of regression in medical contexts.
